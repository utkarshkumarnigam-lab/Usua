## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- A **Google Gemini API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkarshkumarnigam-lab/Usua.git
cd Usua
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Create your `.env` file**

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**4. Launch Usua**

On Windows, simply double-click `launch.bat`, or run:
```bash
node server.js
```

**5. Open in Browser**

On the **same computer**: **`http://127.0.0.1:3000`**

On your **phone or another device** (same WiFi): the server will print a Network URL like:
```
✅ Usua Chat is running!
   ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:3000
   ➜  Network: http://192.168.x.x:3000  ← open this on your phone
```
Just open that Network URL in your phone's browser — no setup needed!

> ✅ No SSL warnings or certificate setup needed — it just works!

> 💡 **Easiest option for phones:** Use the live GitHub Pages link instead — no server required:
> **https://utkarshkumarnigam-lab.github.io/Usua/**

## 🔐 Security

- Your **Gemini API key is never exposed** to the browser or frontend code. It lives exclusively in your `.env` file and is read only by the Node.js backend.
- The server runs locally on `127.0.0.1` — it is not accessible from outside your machine.
- The `.env` file is excluded from Git via `.gitignore`.
