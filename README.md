## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- A **Google Gemini API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkarshkumarnigam-lab/Hasu.git
cd Hasu
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Create your `.env` file**

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**4. Launch Hasu**

On Windows, simply double-click `launch.bat`, or run:
```bash
node server.js
```

**5. Open in Browser**

Navigate to: **`https://127.0.0.1:8443`**

> ⚠️ Your browser may show a "Not Secure" warning on first launch because the SSL certificate is self-signed. You can permanently trust it by running:
> ```bash
> certutil -addstore -user root .\certs\cert.pem
> ```

---

## 🔐 Security

- Your **Gemini API key is never exposed** to the browser or frontend code. It lives exclusively in your `.env` file and is read only by the Node.js backend.
- All traffic between your browser and the local server is encrypted over **HTTPS**.
- The `.env` file and `certs/` directory are excluded from Git via `.gitignore`.
